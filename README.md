# Apple Stock Close Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts the closing price of Apple (AAPL) stock using machine learning techniques.
Historical stock market data is used to train the model and make future price predictions.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze historical Apple stock data and build a predictive model
that can estimate the closing price based on past trends.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
- "Apple_historical_data.csv"
- The dataset contains historical stock price data including open, high, low, close prices, and volume.

## Project Workflow
1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Feature scaling
4. Model training using Random Forest algorithm
5. Model evaluation
6. Price prediction

## Files Included
- "data.ipynb" – Data preprocessing and model training
- "app.py" – Application script for prediction
- "Apple_historical_data.csv" – Historical stock data
- "random_forest_apple_model.pkl" – Trained machine learning model
- "scaler.pkl" – Feature scaler
- "requirements.txt" – Required Python libraries

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Open notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. Run each cell to understand the concepts

## Results
The trained model is able to predict Apple stock closing prices with reasonable accuracy
based on historical data patterns.
